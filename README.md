## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd job-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

5. Run the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API on `http://localhost:3001` (or next available port)

### Database Setup

The project includes Supabase migrations in the `supabase/migrations` directory. These will set up:

- Jobs table with RLS policies
- Subcontractors table
- Profiles table for user management
- Admin invitations system
- Job updates tracking
- Necessary functions and triggers
